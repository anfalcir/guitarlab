# Documentation map

Updated: 2026-09-20

## Authority rule
Repository documentation is split into **live authority**, **normative contracts**, and **historical evidence**.

A historical document may intentionally contain an old statement such as “current”, “latest”, “pending”, an old branch name or an old hardware target because it preserves contemporaneous evidence. Such statements apply only to that document's dated context and **never override the live authority set below**.

## Live authority — signed #659 / current H36 source line
Use these first for current status, release identity and remaining work:
- `README.md` — repository entry point;
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` — current signed authority and remaining physical residual;
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — current system/release architecture;
- `DECISIONS.md` — durable product/engineering decisions, with later decisions superseding earlier ones;
- `PRODUCT_VISION.md` and `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` — destination and required behavior;
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` — milestone/release sequence;
- `POST_H28_HARDENING_AND_EXTERNAL_CONTROL_PLAN.md` — H29→1.1 implementation/closure plan;
- `CANDIDATE_IDENTITY_POLICY.md` — candidate identity/provenance rules;
- `CI_PIPELINE.md` — manual CI, source materialization and signing provenance;
- `TEST_AND_HOMOLOGATION_PLAN.md` — current automated/physical evidence boundary;
- `RC3_FINAL_PHYSICAL_HOMOLOGATION.md` — current target-device checklist bound to CI #659;
- `RELEASE_NOTES_0.5.0-rc3.md` — active RC3 behavior delta;
- `H35_TAKE_SYNC_QUIET_CALIBRATION.md` — global-vs-take synchronization and quiet/silent calibration contract;
- `H36_SETTINGS_UX_POLISH.md` — current Settings/calibration presentation refinement and pre-gate evidence.

## Normative subsystem contracts
These define behavior and remain valid unless explicitly superseded:
- `RECORDING_LATENCY_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `RECORDING_LATENCY_CONTRACT.md`;
- `MANAGED_MEDIA_POLICY.md`;
- `CODEC_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` and `MEDIA_IO_SUPPORT_CLAIM_RULE.md`;
- `PROJECT_PORTABILITY_CONTRACT.md`;
- `TIMELINE_INTERACTION_GUIDELINES.md`;
- `STUDIO_WORKSPACE_GUIDELINES.md` and `STUDIO_OPTIONS_AND_MIXER.md`;
- `UI_VISUAL_SYSTEM.md`, `UI_COPY_STYLE.md`, `TRANSIENT_FEEDBACK_CONTRACT.md`, `USER_GUIDE_POLICY.md`;
- `SHARE_MODAL_CONTRACT.md`;
- `H28_BACKUP_IDENTITY_CONSISTENCY.md` as the protected current backup identity/provider-consistency contract;
- `H26_SAF_CLOUD_BACKUP.md` and `H27_BACKUP_HISTORY_RELEASE_UX.md` only for the retained architecture/supersession details they explicitly identify.

## Historical/superseded evidence
These are preserved for traceability and must not be used as current-state authority:
- `HISTORICAL_CANDIDATES.md` and all `ALPHA*`, `M4_*`, `M5_*`, `M5C_*`, `M6_*`, `M7_*` candidate/checkpoint/checklist documents;
- older release notes `RELEASE_NOTES_0.4.0-alpha2.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_0.5.0-rc1.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES_0.5.0-rc2.md`;
- all dated `DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT_*.md` snapshots;
- `PHYSICAL_EDITING_RECORDING_HARDENING_PLAN.md` — historical H0-H6 rationale;
- `M8_GLOBAL_DIGITAL_REGRESSION.md` — historical regression snapshot around CI #615;
- `GITLAB_CI_MIGRATION.md` — inactive migration proposal;
- milestone-specific evidence such as `M2_HOMOLOGATION_EVIDENCE.md`, `H22_AUDIO_ROUTE_UX.md`, `H24_HOME_PROJECT_LIBRARY.md`, `H25_UI_SETTINGS_SAFETY.md`, `H26D_MATERIALIZER_RECOVERY.md`, `H26E_CI650_DIGITAL_PASS.md` and similar exact-source records.

## Current evidence boundary
CI #659 / run `35512894518` / producer `a6a53e8ba9e75b32565e451870758c7c65ad687f` is the current signed DIGITAL PASS through H35a.

Signed APK SHA-256: `e7ddce638a83d92af0ef2a01e46a10152f8c0eb4c535f0ddbc8671d9b94a1295`.

H28 backup/provider-consistency behavior is already physically accepted. H36 is SOURCE PRE-GATE on top of #659 and does not change audio semantics. Remaining stable-1.0 physical work is recording alignment, USB loss/reconnect/capture preservation, the continuous 10-minute quality exercise and H35 target-device synchronization/calibration behavior. H33 real-controller physical acceptance is a separate 1.1 boundary.

## Repository audits
- `REPOSITORY_SANITIZATION_2026-09-20.md` records the branch audit supporting a single-branch (`main`) repository cleanup.
- `DOCUMENTATION_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT_2026-09-20.md` records the full 88-file documentation consistency review and the live-vs-historical authority rules.

## Producer identity rule
A later docs-only commit never retroactively changes an already-produced APK identity. Every promoted candidate remains bound to its exact workflow producer SHA and signed APK hash.
